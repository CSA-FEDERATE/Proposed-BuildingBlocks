## ID (unique name)

## Description
Eclipse Cyclone DDS is a very performant and robust open-source implementation of the OMG DDS specification. Cyclone DDS is developed completely in the open as an Eclipse IoT project (see eclipse-cyclone-dds) with a growing list of adopters (if you're one of them, please add your logo). It is a tier-1 middleware for the Robot Operating System ROS 2.

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
Cyclone DDS aims at full coverage of the specs and today already covers most of this. With references to the individual OMG specifications, the following is available:

    [DCPS](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/1.4/PDF) the base specification 
             zero configuration discovery (if multicast works)
             publish/subscribe messaging
             configurable storage of data in subscribers
             many QoS settings - liveliness monitoring, deadlines, historical data, ...
             coverage includes the Minimum, Ownership and (partially) Content profiles
    [DDS Security](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-SECURITY/1.1/PDF) - providing authentication, access control and encryption - 
    [DDS C++ API](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-PSM-Cxx/1.0/PDF)
    [DDS XTypes](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-XTypes/1.3/PDF) - the structural type system (some [caveats](https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/blob/master/docs/dev/xtypes_relnotes.md) here) 
    [DDSI-RTPS](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/2.5/PDF) - the interoperable network protocol

## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->

## What is needed to build and run
In order to build Cyclone DDS you need a Linux, Mac or Windows 10 machine (or, with some caveats, a *BSD, QNX, OpenIndiana or a Solaris 2.6 one) with the following installed on your host:

C compiler (most commonly GCC on Linux, Visual Studio on Windows, Xcode on macOS);
Optionally GIT version control system;
CMake, version 3.16 or later;
Optionally OpenSSL, we recommend a fully patched and supported version but 1.1.1 will still work;
Optionally Eclipse Iceoryx version 2.0 for shared memory and zero-copy support;
Optionally Bison parser generator. A cached source is checked into the repository.

## Non-Functional Requirements
Real Time
QOS

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->
