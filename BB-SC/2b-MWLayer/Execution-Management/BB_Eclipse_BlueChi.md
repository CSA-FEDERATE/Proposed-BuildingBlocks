# Eclipse Bluechi
## BB Tags(s)
<!-- Tag(s) define in which area(s) (cloud, in-vehicle) the BB is executed, and what type of BB it is (tool, process, microservice) -->
BB-SC

## Functional Clusters
<!-- In which Functional Cluster the BB be located; if none of the existing fit new required -->

## Layer
<!-- AppLayer, MWLayer, OSLayer, HWLayer -->
MWLayer

## BB Usage
<!-- Example on how to use BB or link to documentation. Should include code snippets, information about usage, 
trainings, skills, examples and how-to's. -->


## Known Implementation

## ID (unique name)

## Description
<!-- General Description of the BB -->
Eclipse BlueChi™ is a systemd service controller intended for multi-node environments with a predefined number of nodes and with a focus on highly regulated ecosystems such as those requiring functional safety. Potential use cases can be found in domains such as transportation, where services need to be controlled across different edge devices and where traditional orchestration tools are not compliant with regulatory requirements.

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
<!-- Reference to e.g. UN/EU CRA Cyber Resilience Act; UNECE 156 - Software update and software update management system
Reference to defined S-BB(s) 
Reference to e.g. IS026262, AUTOSAR Spec. X -->


## Compose BB(s)
<!-- Link to required BB(s) 
E.g. BB-SC StateManagement 
BB is a composition of other BBs -->


## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->

## What is needed to build and run
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability, or Runtime Environment, or Pre-configuration, or Code-signing, or Test, … -->
systemd

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- With respect to Safety, Security, Realtime, … -->
TBD

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->
TBD

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->
No

## Author/Company
Eclipse Foundation

## Priority
<!-- High, Medium, Low -->

## Contribution through RDI projects
<!-- If Yes – e.g. The BB should be used/added in the Eclipse Blueprint A – for demo purposes, show added value,
If No – Project Proposal (e.g. WP4 in FEDERATE, or in the SDV EcoSystem Community Framework) -->


## Availability of Source Code
<!-- Yes / License (e.g. Yes/MIT) 
No – Commercial Closed Source -->
YES - LGPL-2.1

## Availability of API
<!-- Yes / License (e.g. Yes/Apache 2.0)
No - Commercial -->
Yes

## Type of API
<!-- Web API, Library/Framework API, Operating System API, Database API, Remote API, Hardware API, Other -->

## Potential obstacles
TBD
