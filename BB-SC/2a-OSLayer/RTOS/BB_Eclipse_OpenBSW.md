# Eclipse OpenBSW
## BB Tags(s)
<!-- Tag(s) define in which area(s) (cloud, in-vehicle) the BB is executed, and what type of BB it is (tool, process, microservice) -->
BB-SC, BB-EST

## Functional Clusters
<!-- In which Functional Cluster the BB be located; if none of the existing fit new required -->

## Layer
<!-- AppLayer, MWLayer, OSLayer, HWLayer -->
MWLayer, OSLayer

## BB Usage
<!-- Example on how to use BB or link to documentation. Should include code snippets, information about usage, 
trainings, skills, examples and how-to's. -->


## Known Implementation

## ID (unique name)

## Description
<!-- General Description of the BB -->
Eclipse OpenBSW is an open source SDK to build professional, high quality embedded software products. It is a software stack specifically designed and developed for automotive applications.

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
<!-- Reference to e.g. UN/EU CRA Cyber Resilience Act; UNECE 156 - Software update and software update management system
Reference to defined S-BB(s) 
Reference to e.g. IS026262, AUTOSAR Spec. X -->


## Compose BB(s)
<!-- Link to required BB(s) 
E.g. BB-SC StateManagement 
BB is a composition of other BBs -->


## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->

## What is needed to build and run
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability, or Runtime Environment, or Pre-configuration, or Code-signing, or Test, … -->

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- With respect to Safety, Security, Realtime, … -->
TBD

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->
TBD

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->
No

## Author/Company
Eclipse Foundation

## Priority
<!-- High, Medium, Low -->

## Contribution supported by RDI projects
<!-- If Yes – e.g. The BB should be used/added in the Eclipse Blueprint A – for demo purposes, show added value,
If No – Project Proposal (e.g. WP4 in FEDERATE, or in the SDV EcoSystem Community Framework) -->
TBD

## Availability of Source Code
<!-- Yes / License (e.g. Yes/MIT) 
No – Commercial Closed Source -->
YES - APL-2.0

## Availability of API
<!-- Yes / License (e.g. Yes/Apache 2.0)
No - Commercial -->
Yes

## Type of API
<!-- Web API, Library/Framework API, Operating System API, Database API, Remote API, Hardware API, Other -->

## Potential obstacles
TBD
