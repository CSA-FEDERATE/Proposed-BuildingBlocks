## Description
<!-- General Description of the BB -->
Control the handling of vehicle power in various ECU by provides generic
services for handling power up and power down phases of the vehicles, to
manage vehicle power transition phase and energy efficiency.
It handles decision for power control based on electronic dependency and
power cascading sequence. It is usually a multi-layer approach, where
states are managed locally for each SW partition, for each sub system and
for the complete vehicle system It is multi-layer approach  

For Linux systems, systemd and how it can help with this concern is probably a highly interesting topic to investigate for this BB.

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->
Unified solution to facilitates integration of vehicle power management
feature.

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
<!-- Reference to e.g. UN/EU CRA Cyber Resilience Act; UNECE 156 - Software update and software update management system
Reference to defined S-BB(s) 
Reference to e.g. IS026262, AUTOSAR Spec. X -->

## Compose BB(s)
<!-- Link to required BB(s) 
E.g. BB-SC StateManagement 
BB is a composition of other BBs -->

## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->

## What is needed to build and run
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability, or Runtime Environment, or Pre-configuration, or Code-signing, or Test, … -->

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- With respect to Safety, Security, Realtime, … -->

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->

## Related Project(s)
<!-- If Yes – e.g. The BB should be used/added in the Eclipse Blueprint A – for demo purposes, show added value,
If No – Project Proposal (e.g. WP4 in FEDERATE, or in the SDV EcoSystem Community Framework -->
