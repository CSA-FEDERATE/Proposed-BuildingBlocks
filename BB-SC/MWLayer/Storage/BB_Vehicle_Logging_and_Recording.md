## BB Tags(s)
<!-- Tag(s) define in which area(s) (cloud, in-vehicle) the BB is executed, and what type of BB it is (tool, process, microservice) -->
BB-SC

## Functional Clusters
<!-- In which Functional Cluster the BB be located; if none of the existing fit new required -->
Storage

## Layer
<!-- AppLayer, MWLayer, OSLayer, HWLayer -->
MWLayer

## Known Implementation

OpenTelemetry

## ID (unique name)

## Description
<!-- General Description of the BB -->
A component in the vehicle which selects data of interest and uploads it to the cloud. It has access to most of the data in the car and selects by filters (AI based or rule based). Typically, the filters are modified by the cloud to enable campaigns in order to collect specific amount of data e.g. for monetization purposes.
It shall support control of access services and access right

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->
One method known is the diagnostic log and trace ("Dlt") which could be used to trace and log via any bus any information with a common time reference that is instrumented in the SW code. It may address also offboard debugging enabled by commonly used tool for dump and performance analysis. Additionally other concepts for logging that are also quite intrusive like Xcp based are established.

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
<!-- Reference to e.g. UN/EU CRA Cyber Resilience Act; UNECE 156 - Software update and software update management system
Reference to defined S-BB(s) 
Reference to e.g. IS026262, AUTOSAR Spec. X -->
AUTOSAR DLT  
AUTOSAR XCP  

## Compose BB(s)
<!-- Link to required BB(s) 
E.g. BB-SC StateManagement 
BB is a composition of other BBs -->

## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->

## What is needed to build and run
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability, or Runtime Environment, or Pre-configuration, or Code-signing, or Test, … -->

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- With respect to Safety, Security, Realtime, … -->

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->

## Priority

## Related Project(s)
<!-- If Yes – e.g. The BB should be used/added in the Eclipse Blueprint A – for demo purposes, show added value,
If No – Project Proposal (e.g. WP4 in FEDERATE, or in the SDV EcoSystem Community Framework -->
