# RTPS Communication Protocol Container

This Container host various implementations of the (RealTime)PublisherSubscriber protocol.

## RTPS Communication Protocol 
The Real-Time Publish-Subscribe (RTPS) protocol is a communication framework designed specifically for distributed, real-time systems. It is widely adopted in domains where low-latency and highly reliable data exchange are essential. RTPS follows a publish-subscribe communication model, enabling the decoupling of data producers (publishers) and data consumers (subscribers), while facilitating flexible, scalable, and efficient communication across nodes within a distributed environment.

## Key Characteristics of RTPS:

* Real-Time Capabilities
* Decentralized Communication
* Data-Centric Design
* Reliability and Quality of Service (QoS)
* Scalability
* Suitability for Embedded Systems
