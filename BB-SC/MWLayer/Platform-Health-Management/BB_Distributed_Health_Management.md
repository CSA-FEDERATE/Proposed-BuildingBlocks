## BB Tags(s)
<!-- Tag(s) define in which area(s) (cloud, in-vehicle) the BB is executed, and what type of BB it is (tool, process, microservice) -->
BB-SC

## Functional Clusters
<!-- In which Functional Cluster the BB be located; if none of the existing fit new required -->
Platform Health Management

## Layer
<!-- AppLayer, MWLayer, OSLayer, HWLayer -->

## Description
<!-- General Description of the BB -->
Distributed health management like state management must be
orchestrated in states through the SW Partitions, subsystems, and
systems as well as the reaction to "unhealthiness" of the system.
Define services and hierarchy of services to handled cascading of failure
detection and recovery to easily integrate safety concept.

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->
Services is tightly coupled to the safety concept, which is depending on the hardware capabilities and the functional safety goals. Therefore, the
concrete instantiation of a distributed health management concept is highly product specific, but the infrastructure how to exchange health information and how to trigger status changes could be standardized.

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
<!-- Reference to e.g. UN/EU CRA Cyber Resilience Act; UNECE 156 - Software update and software update management system
Reference to defined S-BB(s) 
Reference to e.g. IS026262, AUTOSAR Spec. X -->
AUTOSAR Classic  
AUTOSAR Adaptive  

## Compose BB(s)
<!-- Link to required BB(s) 
E.g. BB-SC StateManagement 
BB is a composition of other BBs -->

## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->

## What is needed to build and run
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability, or Runtime Environment, or Pre-configuration, or Code-signing, or Test, … -->

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- With respect to Safety, Security, Realtime, … -->

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->
