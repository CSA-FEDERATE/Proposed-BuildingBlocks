## BB Tags(s)
<!-- Tag(s) define in which area(s) (cloud, in-vehicle) the BB is executed, and what type of BB it is (tool, process, microservice) -->
S-BB

## Functional Clusters
<!-- In which Functional Cluster the BB be located; if none of the existing fit new required -->

## Layer
<!-- AppLayer, MWLayer, OSLayer, HWLayer -->
MWLayer

## Known Implementation

Eclipse uProtocol

## ID (unique name)

## Description
<!-- General Description of the BB -->
Service oriented communication allows services to communicate between ECUs with each other in the vehicle typically by publish-subscribe mechanism. Typically this is enabled by middleware framework implementing a service protocol (SOME/IP, DDS,..) and providing necessary interface connectors in various programming languages.

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->
Standardization of SOA communication services across different vehicle manufacturer

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
<!-- Reference to e.g. UN/EU CRA Cyber Resilience Act; UNECE 156 - Software update and software update management system
Reference to defined S-BB(s) 
Reference to e.g. IS026262, AUTOSAR Spec. X -->
TDB

## Compose BB(s)
<!-- Link to required BB(s) 
E.g. BB-SC StateManagement 
BB is a composition of other BBs -->

## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->

## What is needed to build and run
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability, or Runtime Environment, or Pre-configuration, or Code-signing, or Test, … -->

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- With respect to Safety, Security, Realtime, … -->

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->

## Priority
<!-- High, Medium, Low -->

## Related Project(s)
<!-- If Yes – e.g. The BB should be used/added in the Eclipse Blueprint A – for demo purposes, show added value,
If No – Project Proposal (e.g. WP4 in FEDERATE, or in the SDV EcoSystem Community Framework -->

## Availability of Source Code
<!-- Yes / License (e.g. Yes/MIT) 
No – Commercial Closed Source -->

## Availability of API
<!-- Yes / License (e.g. Yes/Apache 2.0)
No - Commercial -->
