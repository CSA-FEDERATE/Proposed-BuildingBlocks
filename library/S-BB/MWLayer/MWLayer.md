# MWLayer
This software Layer is the major focus of the SDVoF initiative. It consists of (mainly open-source and mostly nondifferentiating) software building blocks, which connect the hardware layer with the
applications layer to allow separated hardware and software development cycles necessary for software-defined vehicles of the future. This layer also ensures the safe execution of the applications of layer 3. It shall consist of software building blocks, which can also be used in existing OEM specific SW stacks. As many applications have on-board and off-board (cloud) parts, a service-oriented interface layer shall also exist in the cloud. The Layer may be use different operating systems in different software-defined vehicle domains such as infotainment, ADAS, automated driving, chassis/powertrain control, body-comfort, etc., but the interfaces shall be the same.
