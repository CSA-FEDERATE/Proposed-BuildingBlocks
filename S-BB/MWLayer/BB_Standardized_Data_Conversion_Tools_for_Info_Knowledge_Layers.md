## BB Tags(s)
<!-- Tag(s) define in which area(s) (cloud, in-vehicle) the BB is executed, and what type of BB it is (tool, process, microservice) -->

## Description
<!-- General Description of the BB -->
This package aims to develop and standardize tools for converting data between the information layer (focusing on raw data collection and storage) and the knowledge layer (centered on processing data into actionable insights), ensuring accuracy and efficiency in data transformation.

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->
This work package addresses the inefficiencies and incompatibilities in current data conversion methods between the information and knowledge layers, which often lead to data loss or misinterpretation. The goal is to develop standardized tools for effective and accurate data conversion, streamlining processing, reducing misinterpretation risks, and enhancing overall efficiency. This will improve data analysis quality and decision making by ensuring precise transformation of raw data into actionable knowledge.  

Example usage: Insight Generation

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
<!-- Reference to e.g. UN/EU CRA Cyber Resilience Act; UNECE 156 - Software update and software update management system
Reference to defined S-BB(s) 
Reference to e.g. IS026262, AUTOSAR Spec. X -->

## Compose BB(s)
<!-- Link to required BB(s) 
E.g. BB-SC StateManagement 
BB is a composition of other BBs -->

## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->
Standardized tools for data conversion, streamlining processing, reducing misinterpretation risks, and enhancing overall efficiency

## What is needed to build and run
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability, or Runtime Environment, or Pre-configuration, or Code-signing, or Test, … -->

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- With respect to Safety, Security, Realtime, … -->

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->

<!-- If Yes – e.g. The BB should be used/added in the Eclipse Blueprint A – for demo purposes, show added value,
If No – Project Proposal (e.g. WP4 in FEDERATE, or in the SDV EcoSystem Community Framework -->
