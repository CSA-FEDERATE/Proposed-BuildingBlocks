## Description
<!-- General Description of the BB -->
This work package aims to develop standardized architectural patterns for a data service infrastructure that encompasses data storage, access, synchronization, and other related functionalities across different platforms.

## Rationale
<!-- Explanation why we need the BB; what problem want to be solved -->
The lack of standardized architectural patterns for data services leads to inefficiencies, compatibility issues, and increased complexity in crossplatform data handling. This work package aims to establish a set of standardized, scalable, and adaptable architectural patterns applicable to various platforms for data services including storage, access, and synchronization. The solution enhances interoperability and efficiency of data services across platforms, reduces complexity, and simplifies integration processes.  

Example usage: integration and operation of various software and hardware components within software-defined vehicles, ensuring consistent and efficient data communication across the vehicle's entire digital ecosystem.

## Governance Applicable S-BB(s)
<!-- Reference to e.g. UN/EU CRA Cyber Resilience Act; UNECE 156 - Software update and software update management system
Reference to defined S-BB(s) 
Reference to e.g. IS026262, AUTOSAR Spec. X -->

## Compose BB(s)
<!-- Link to required BB(s) 
E.g. BB-SC StateManagement 
BB is a composition of other BBs -->

## What is needed to Design and Implement
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability and or SW environment or Tool support, or a documentation, or an extra audit, or Test, or Compiler, or Prog. Language, … -->
Standardized architectural patterns for data service infrastructure and data management

## What is needed to build and run
<!-- e.g. we expect to have a certain HW capability, or Runtime Environment, or Pre-configuration, or Code-signing, or Test, … -->

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- With respect to Safety, Security, Realtime, … -->

## Dependencies to other Clusters
<!-- Other clusters are needed. FC Security, FC Storage, …
e.g. If FC Security : Security BBs are needed but you can choose for example crypto BB-SC from company A or crypto BB-SC from company B; several compositions may work -->

## Vehicle API Relevant
<!-- If “Yes exists” – where – e.g. COVESA VSS 
If “No” – nothing more to do 
If “Yes, proposal for additional Signals/Information – what should be made available, and where e.g. via (COVESA) VSS/VISS -->
