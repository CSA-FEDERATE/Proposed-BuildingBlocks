# Security and Compliance (with Data Centric Access)

The Security and Compliance building block class provides the frameworks, tools, 
and processes to protect systems, data, and operations from unauthorized access, 
vulnerabilities, and threats while ensuring adherence to regulatory and industry 
standards. A data-centric access approach is embedded to prioritize the protection 
and management of data as a primary asset, ensuring security measures are directly 
tied to data sensitivity, usage, and compliance requirements. In environments like 
Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs), where safety, connectivity, and real-time 
decision-making are paramount, robust security measures and strict compliance 
protocols are critical. This building block addresses risks holistically, from 
edge devices to cloud infrastructure, ensuring end-to-end protection and compliance.
