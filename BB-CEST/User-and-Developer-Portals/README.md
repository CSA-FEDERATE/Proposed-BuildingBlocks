# User and Developer Portals

The User and Developer Portals building block class provides centralized 
platforms for accessing, managing, and interacting with Software Defined 
Vehicle (SDV) ecosystems. These portals serve as the primary interface for 
developers, operators, and end-users to collaborate, configure systems, 
and access critical tools and resources. By integrating self-service 
capabilities, APIs, and documentation, this building block simplifies 
system management, accelerates development workflows, and enhances 
the user experience.

## Subclasses are:

* Analytics-and-Insights

* Collaboration-Tools

* Developer-Portals

* Integration-with-SDV-EcoSystem

* Securtiy-and-Access-Control
