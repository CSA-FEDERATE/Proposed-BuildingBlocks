# Operation and Maintenance

The Operations and Maintenance building block calss encompasses the tools, processes, 
and frameworks required to manage, monitor, and maintain systems throughout their lifecycle. 
In the context of Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs), this building block ensures seamless 
operation, proactive maintenance, and efficient incident management. It focuses on minimizing 
downtime, optimizing performance, and supporting the ongoing evolution of software and 
hardware components. By integrating automation, observability, and predictive analytics, 
Operations and Maintenance is a critical enabler for reliable and scalable SDV ecosystems.
Some of the subclasses have strong connections, dependencies and overlaps with other building 
block classes and subclasses.

## Subclasses are:

* Automation-and-Orchestration

* Incident-Management

* Lifecycle-Management

* Monitoring-and-Observability

* Over-the-Air-Updates (OTA)

* Predictive-Maintenance

* Security-and-Compiance-in-Operation
