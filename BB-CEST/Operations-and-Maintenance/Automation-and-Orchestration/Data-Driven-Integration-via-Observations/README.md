# Data Driven Integration via Oberservation

Data-driven integration via observation is an approach that leverages real-time and historical 
data to enable seamless interactions between distributed systems.By continuously monitoring 
system behaviour, collecting telemetry, and analysing patterns, this approach allows for dynamic, 
intelligent integration of components in Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and other complex 
ecosystems. A key distinction of this approach lies in its independence from predefined interfaces 
and static configurations, a departure from conventional integration methodologies. The dynamic 
and event-driven interactions facilitated by this approach enhance operational efficiency, 
enhance fault tolerance, and facilitate more effective decision-making processes.
