# Event Driven Automation

Event-driven automation is an approach in which system actions and workflows are automatically 
triggered in response to real-time events, system state changes, or telemetry data, as opposed 
to relying on pre-scheduled tasks or manual interventions. This automation model ensures that 
responses to key system events are executed instantly and efficiently. In the context of 
Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs), this automation model assumes a pivotal role in domains such 
as predictive maintenance, real-time system adaptation, security incident handling, and 
Over-the-Air (OTA) updates.The efficacy of this approach is evidenced by its enhancement of 
scalability, operational efficiency, and responsiveness. This enhancement is attained by the 
reduction of latency, the minimisation of manual intervention, and the assurance of dynamic 
system responses to evolving conditions.
