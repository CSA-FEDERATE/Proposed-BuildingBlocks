# Automated Testing and Validation

Automated Testing and Validation refers to the process of using software tools and 
frameworks to execute predefined tests on systems, applications, or components without 
human intervention. This approach ensures the reliability, performance, security, and 
compliance of software by validating its behavior against expected outcomes. In the 
context of Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs), automated testing and validation are 
critical to managing the complexity of software updates, real-time operations, and 
safety-critical applications. These processes help streamline development cycles, 
reduce manual effort, and ensure that SDV systems meet stringent quality and 
regulatory standards.
