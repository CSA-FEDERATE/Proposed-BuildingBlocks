# Development Testing and Simulation Environments

The Development and Testing Environments building block provides the tools, 
frameworks, and infrastructure necessary to design, develop, test, and validate 
software in a structured and efficient manner. It enables rapid iteration, 
thorough testing, and high-quality software deployment, ensuring reliability and 
performance in production. This building block is particularly critical in 
complex systems like Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs), where software updates, 
safety, and regulatory compliance must be rigorously verified.

## Subclasses are:

* Continuous-Integration-Continuous-Deployment (CI/CD)

* Cloud-Based-Development-Environments

* Debugging-and-Monitoring

* Integrated-Development-Environments (IDEs)

* Performance-and-Load-Testing

* Simulation-and-Emulation-Tools

* Software-Development-Kits (SDKs)

* Testing-Frameworks
