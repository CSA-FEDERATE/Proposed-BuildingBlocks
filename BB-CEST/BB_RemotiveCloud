Description	
RemotiveCloud - for sharing vehicle recordings, both for debugging purposes as well as for prototyping (feed data into e.g. ProtoPie and Android AAOS / AOSP emulators). The recordings can be made with the RemotiveBroker or some other logging devices following standard formats.   
Rationale	RemotiveCloud enables an easy way of sharing recordings - upload to cloud and share with relevant people as suppliers and service providers to have a common place for vehicle network data (CAN etc.) for debugging and 3rd party application developers.

Vehicle API Relevant 
Yes, the output can be made in COVESA VSS / VISS format - both to make it easy for 3rd parties as well as to hide OEM proprietary info

Related Project(s) (Yes/No) 
Yes, part of Playground under the COVESA umbrella. 
No active role in FEDERATE yet but there should be a good fit under WP2 projects where there is a need to collaborate in an easy way when it comes to vehicle data (from a test rig or an actual vehicle) for both debugging as well as prototyping purposes (either OEM propritary format or COVESA VSS).
