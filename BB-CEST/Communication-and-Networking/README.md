# Communication and Networking

The Communication and Networking building block class provides the 
foundational technologies and protocols that enable seamless and 
secure data exchange between systems, devices, and the cloud. 
In dynamic environments like Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs), 
robust communication and networking frameworks are essential to 
support real-time data transfer, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) 
communication, and edge-to-cloud interactions. This building block 
ensures low-latency, high-reliability connections critical for safety, 
performance, and scalability in connected ecosystems.
