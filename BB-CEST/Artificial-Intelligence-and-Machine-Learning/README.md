# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (with a Data-Centric Appraoch)

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) building block class provides 
the tools, frameworks, and methodologies required to develop, deploy, and manage 
intelligent systems. By integrating a data-centric approach, this building block 
emphasizes the quality, relevance, and management of data as the cornerstone for 
successful AI/ML solutions. In complex environments such as Software Defined 
Vehicles (SDVs), where large volumes of data are generated in real-time, this 
approach ensures robust, scalable, and accurate AI/ML capabilities, enabling 
enhanced decision-making, automation, and personalization.
