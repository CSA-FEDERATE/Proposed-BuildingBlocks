# MWLayer

The folders under the MWLayer are based on each of the AUTOSAR adaptive platforms (R23-11) and represent
so-called Functional Clusters (FC). These are expanded and adapted as required.
A Functional Cluster (FC): Combines technically similar functionalities or function groups (FG)
into a Functional Cluster (logical structure unit).
