# Configuration as Code (CaS)

Configuration as Code (CaC) is a methodology that uses machine-readable files to define 
and manage system configurations, infrastructure setups, and application settings. By 
treating configuration as code, organizations can apply software development practices 
such as version control, automated testing, and continuous delivery to their 
infrastructure and application configurations. In the context of Software Defined Vehicles 
(SDVs), CaC ensures consistent, scalable, and repeatable deployment of configurations 
across cloud, edge, and in-vehicle environments, reducing human error and streamlining 
complex operations.
