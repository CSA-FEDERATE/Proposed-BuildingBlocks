# Automation and Orchestration

The Automation and Orchestration subclass within the Operations and Maintenance building block 
focuses on implementing tools, frameworks, and processes that streamline the management and 
execution of repetitive tasks, complex workflows, and system-wide operations. In the context of 
Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs), automation and orchestration enable consistent and efficient 
management of cloud, edge, and in-vehicle systems. This subclass ensures that SDV ecosystems 
remain scalable, resilient, and adaptable to evolving demands while reducing manual intervention.
