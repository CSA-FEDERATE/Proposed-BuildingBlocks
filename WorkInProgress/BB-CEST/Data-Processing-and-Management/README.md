# Data Processing and Management

The Data Processing and Management building block provides a framework for the 
collection, processing, storage and analysis of vast quantities of data generated 
by connected systems, ensuring seamless data flow from edge devices to the cloud 
and back, thereby enabling actionable insights and intelligent decision-making.
Central to this building block is the adoption of data-centric architectures, 
where data is the primary asset driving design, operations and innovation. This 
approach is especially critical in dynamic environments like Software Defined 
Vehicles (SDVs), where data underpins core functionalities such as real-time 
decision-making, predictive maintenance, and autonomous operations.
