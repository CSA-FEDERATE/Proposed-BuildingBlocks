## Description
With Eclipse SKyBT the test designers are able to describe the system under test as a model by using a defined syntax and keywords. The model includes the definition and selection of the needed interfaces, logical relations as a state machine and description of the logical objects with keyword sentences.
Custom keywords can be defined as needed for the current project. Platform or communication definitions can be imported and then be used as keywords. The keyword and syntax management are embedded.
Form these keyword-based models of the system under test the test designer is able to generate the needed test case using the test case generator.
Of course, the user is also able to write classic test cases based on the syntax and keywords.
The models and test cases can be combined with parameters and test data sets.
As most of the test departments already have a working test management, test cases can be exported to the used application lifecycle management tools.
Coming from the ALM tool the configured test suites can be executed in the used test automation. Since the test cases are based on keywords, there is no need to implement or update the test case. All test cases that are based on the already implemented keywords can be executed directly.
